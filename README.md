# Stock Portfolio Optimization with Python

Modern portfolio theory (MPT) was formulated by the economist Harry Markowitz at 1952, and later won him a Nobel Prize. The key concept of MPT is that by calculating the risk, expected returns, and correlations between stocks one can choose a portfolio (a group of holdings in different stocks) to maximize his expected returns. His methods, now standard at every hedge-fund, rely on optimizing a complex multi variable function. Hence, many economists focus on coming up with ways to convert the equations to convex optimizations problems that can be easily approximated numerically.
